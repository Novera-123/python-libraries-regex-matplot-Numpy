Galactic COVID-19 Data Analysis
**Overview**
Welcome to the Galactic COVID-19 Data Analysis project! This project explores fictional COVID-19 data from three planets in the Star Wars universe: Tatooine, Naboo, and Alderaan. The dataset includes daily cases, recoveries, and deaths for four cities on each planet.

**Objective**
The primary objective of this project is to showcase fundamental data analysis techniques using the powerful NumPy library in Python. Throughout the project, we leverage slicing, aggregating, and visualizing data in NumPy arrays to gain insights into the progression of the fictional pandemic across different planets and cities.

**Key Features**
Data Representation: The COVID-19 data is structured as NumPy arrays, providing an efficient and powerful way to handle and analyze multidimensional data.

Slicing and Indexing: Learn how to effectively slice and index NumPy arrays to extract specific information, such as daily statistics for individual cities.

Aggregation and Summary Statistics: Explore techniques for aggregating data to obtain summary statistics, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's impact on each planet.

Data Visualization: Utilize Matplotlib to create insightful visualizations, aiding in the interpretation of trends and patterns in the COVID-19 data.

In addition to the main data analysis features, this project utilizes regular expressions (regex) to handle and validate specific patterns within the dataset
